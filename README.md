# Musable
Musable is a music server to stream your own music files accross all different kind of devices. It's using the [Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement/Audio) (HTMLAudioElement) element so it has support for lots of devices. I got inspired to make this project because I wanted to listen to my music from my phone outside of the house.<br/>

# Usage

npm run start
```
